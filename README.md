An average person watches more than 4 hours of videos everyday.
All recomendations are not good.
We solve the problem of content discovery by providing updates on how your friends are reacting to the content in real time. This helps our users to find the best and trending content among their peers.

ProReview does facial recognition and tracks your expressions whether you are watching a “Pewdiepie” video on youtube or watching Jake paul. LOL

So imagine a particular video which has been watched 1000 times, we have the data to show where people laughed, got scared, and we can even tell when users got bored.

The bottomline is once ProReview is on,

Users can express in a more natural form than anything else out there, inc Facebook likes, or tweets. This form of expression is hassle-free.
Users can know upfront what to expect from the video.
It can help users facilitate conversation based on how people reacted to it.


Welcome to the future of how videos will be watched, recommended, and Expressed. :)

P.S. Our Platform is complete and ready to use. :)
